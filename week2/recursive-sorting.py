### Objective challenge:
### 1. Write a recursive search function that receives as input an array of integers and a target integer value. This function should return True if the target element exists in the array, and False otherwise.
### 2. What would be the base case(s) weâ€™d have to consider for implementing this function?
### 3. How should our recursive solution converge on our base case(s)?

### Objective challenge:
### 1. What will the contents of the array below be after each pass of the Merge Sort algorithm? merge-challenge
### 2. What will the contents of the array below be after each pass of the Quick Sort algorithm? (assume the first element is chosen as the pivot)
